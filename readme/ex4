Project:** SEG2105 Assignment 2
Components:** OCSF Client-Server Chat System
Author: Zachary Yassine
Student ID: 300419310

Overview
This project implements a basic chat system using the OCSF framework.
The system includes:

* A server (`EchoServer`)
* A text-based client (`ClientConsole`)
* A network communication layer (`ChatClient`)
* Support for console commands on both client and server side

---

How to Compile and Run

1. Start the Server

```
cd src
javac edu/seg2105/edu/server/backend/EchoServer.java
java edu.seg2105.edu.server.backend.EchoServer
```

Expected output:

```
Server listening for connections on port 5555
```

2. Start the Client

```
cd src
javac edu/seg2105/client/ui/ClientConsole.java
java edu.seg2105.client.ui.ClientConsole <loginID> localhost 5555
```

Example:

```
java edu.seg2105.client.ui.ClientConsole zac localhost 5555
```

If `loginID` is missing, the client terminates with an error message.

Notes

* The program must be run **from the project root** so package paths resolve correctly.
* Only standard Java and the OCSF framework are used.
